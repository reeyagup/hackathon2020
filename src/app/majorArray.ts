  {major: 'Zoology', description: 'Many majors, like Zoology, require a great amount of research and experimentation. The process of collecting, analyzing, and visualizing data can be tedious, but Python and R allow for easy organization and interpretation of data. R is great for generating statistics and communicating the results effectively and in a variety of ways. Python is great in that it serves many general purposes and is easy to understand, making code accessable and readable for many (and collaboration easier).'},
  {major: 'Aerospace Engineering', description: 'Aerospace Engineering Majors deal with long calculations that include physical principles, making the use of mathematical programs such as R and MatLab very useful. Moreover, AE majors can work on the systems used in aircraft and rockets, making C and Java useful programming languages.'}
